 <p>This program was created in a course called Program Structure. Prior to this class, I had not taken programming very seriously. I would often do the bare minimum to complete projects and assignments, and I learned very little about anything as a result. However, upon reading the instructions for this bank interface project, for some reason I decided that I would give my all into making sure this project came out as polished as possible. Thus my college career took a turning point as I discovered that I had some smidgen of competence in coding. This bank interface project may not be the most impressive program I have written, but I had learned much from it, so I hold it very dear to my heart.</p>

<p>From this assignment, I gained all my C and C++ knowledge. This project had two parts. In the first, I created the whole program in C, and in the second I converted the existing C code into C++ code to make use of certain classes and structures in C++. Doing this required that I extensively read up on some C++ documentation on the basic input and output buffers.</p>
