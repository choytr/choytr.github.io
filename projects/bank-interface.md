summary: "A coding project from the class that taught me C. This is the first project in which I felt like I could showcase my capabilities as a programmer."
---

This program was created in a course called Program Structure. Prior to this class, I had not taken programming very seriously. I would often do the bare minimum to complete projects and assignments, and I learned very little about anything as a result. However, upon reading the instructions for this bank interface project, for some reason I decided that I would give my all into making sure this project came out as polished as possible. Thus my college career took a turning point as I discovered that I had some smidgen of competence in coding. This bank interface project may not be the most impressive program I have written, but I had learned much from it, so I hold it very dear to my heart.
