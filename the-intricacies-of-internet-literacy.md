# How to be literate on the web

The concept of internet literacy refers to one's ability to utilize the internet effectively in order to gain information or fulfil one's objectives. The internet is a vast place with an over-abundance of information, but in order to use it well, you must know where and how to look for answers. It is ultimately your own fault for not knowing how to find the answer you are looking for, or whether or not your problems are even solvable through the internet.

## The Bad Thread

In this Stack Overflow thread, the title, which reads "Create custom tab bar in flutter," does not read like a technical problem whatsoever. In fact, it does not even look like a problem; it looks like the title for a tutorial article on tab bars in Flutter. Titles are the first thing that any forum browser will see. They are the first impression to a question among the sea of countless queries that pop up every single minute. If, in the very first few words, you cannot convey the issue you are having clearly, it will almost always be ignored.

However, this is a secondary priority to simply having a quality problem to post to a forum, and this thread fails to accomplish even that. A good forum discussion or support post topic would not be so vague or overly-complicated for the forum's users to have an easier time answering. In this case, from the body of the post it appears this post was made to ask how to create a custom tab bar in Flutter. Two screenshots are provided, one presumably of a desired outcome and the other... showcases the poster's abilities? A question like this asking for an entire tutorial on how to design and create an entire user-interfacce is way too vague and encompasses too many aspects for anyone to spend a reasonable amount of time asking. Instead, the poster's time would have been much more well-spent even attempting to start creating their desired interface, and later create a forum post once they discover a specific issue during development.

There is also a giant block of code with zero explanation at the end of the post. Assuming it is the code for the tab bar they are developng, it is way too long and complex for any single person to comprehend, not to mention the lack of explanation for its existence. Is there something to debug? Is there something wrong with the code? Are they looking for suggestions to make it cleaner?

## The Good Thread

In stark contrast, this thread is formatted excellently. Following a concise 'object-deviation' format, a glance at the title is all it takes to understand the problem at hand.

Its topic was obviously something the original poster had contemplated and attempted to solve on their own. Their question,
