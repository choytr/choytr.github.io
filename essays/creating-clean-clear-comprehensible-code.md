A few days ago, a friend of mine who was an exchange student from the mainland came to for help on one of his coding assignments for an intermediate level Java course. He was by no means a novice when it came to programming; he had experience in Python from his first few college semesters on the mainland. However, due to credit transferring issues, he needed to take most of his intro-level courses again. Regarding the assignment he requested help with, I managed to help point out a few errors that were due to him misreading his instructions. Finding the errors themselves was all fine and dandy; it was a trivial matter. However, what was not trivial was the sheer amount of effort I needed to put into simply comprehending his code.

I can sympathize with my friend for procrastinating on and rushing through his coding assignments for this introductory course. The assignments he was forced to do were designed and created for essentially beginners in coding. For an intermediate-level student like him, these homeworks must have been mind-numbingly boring and likely nearly unbearable to power through since they were large projects due at the end of each week. This is why I am not even mad that his coding style and standards were all over the place. I am not mad that he sloppily placed his brackets,
