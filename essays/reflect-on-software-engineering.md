## Resourcefulness in software engineering
I learned a lot from ICS 314, Software Engineering I, but by far my biggest takeaway is that one of the most crucial skills you can have as a software engineer is the ability to be resourceful. What I mean by that is how to use the tools around you to write high quality code. This includes how to read documentation, how to dig through forums, and possessing the general knowledge about how to find what you need. It is an intuition, a skill, that you develop as you do more development. It does not matter what programming language you need to write in, or what specific technology you are required to utilize, as depending on the context, you can either gain a lot or very little by completely knowing a specific piece of technology inside out. Regardless, you simply can't learn everything. Now more than ever, knowing how to use the resources around to to do just what you need to is imperative.

My experience in learning software development through ICS 314 was focused on the development of websites. The majority of the semester was spent building up the fundamental skills necessary to build a website using Meteor, a full-stack (provides both front-end and back-end) web application development framework that implements React for the user interface and MongoDB for the database of the application. The last month of the semester was the duration of our final project, which was to build a full Meteor application from scratch. Throughout the development process of the final project, 

one particular tool I found very helpful was artificial intelligence.

When learning a new technology, you can ask AI how to apply some design pattern you've used before in the tech stack you're using.

### ChatGPT
Examples of how AI can help guide you in the right direction or summarize dense documentation

## User Interface Frameworks
Can ask ChatGPT how concepts in one framework can relate to another framework
Asking ChatGPT how to implement a bootstrap dropdown button as a MUI button led me to the discovery of the `as` React property.


## Design Patterns
Apply AI to doing the same things across different languages
