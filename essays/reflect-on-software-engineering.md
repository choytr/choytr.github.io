## How to be resourceful
My biggest takeaway from ICS 314, Software Engineering I, is that one of the most crucial skills you can have as a software engineer is the ability to be resourceful. What I mean by that is how to use the tools around you to write high quality code. This includes how to read documentation, how to dig through forums, and possessing general knowledge about how to find what you need. It is an intuition, a skill, that you develop as you do more development. It does not matter what programming language you need to write in, or what specific technology you are required to utilize, as depending on the context, you can either gain a lot or very little by completely knowing a specific piece of technology inside out. Regardless, you simply can't learn everything. Now more than ever, knowing how to use the resources around to to do what you need to do is imperative.



Talk about AI

When learning a new technology, you can ask AI how to apply some design pattern you've used before in the tech stack you're using.
