They say you can't rush art. Creating a truly beautiful painting or sculpture takes great takes devotion, practice, patience, and a lot of time. It's not just art that this applies to; it takes the same amount of effort to become great at anything, whether it's art, music, or perhaps coding. I think there is a common denominator in the key to success in every field, and that is repetition. The most common thing I've heard from experienced people or read on a guide on how to improve at some subject is that you have to do that thing over and over again consistently for a very long time. Such a phrase is repeated by so many professionals that it's almost common knowledge now.

Of course, this piece of knowledge is nothing new. For as long as humans have been able to think, this was understood by all who wished to be great at something. Now, it is my turn to test my patience and slowly begin my path toward greatness.

As I elaborated in my "Learning" essay, WOD stands for "Workout Of the Day," and represents the coding problems us students were required to complete. What I did not mention was that there were also practice WODs assigned as homework. Considering that class only took place twice a week, these extra practice WODs significantly contributed to the effectiveness of the athletic software engineering teaching style. Since I had a structured way of practicing coding most every day, my learning experience was improved tremendously.
